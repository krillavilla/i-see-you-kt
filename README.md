# üïµÔ∏è i-see-you-kt

Welcome to my Computer Vision portfolio, developed as part of the **Udacity Computer Vision Nanodegree**. This repository showcases all projects and challenges I completed while building core skills in computer vision, deep learning, and neural network architectures.

## üìö About the Program

The **Computer Vision Nanodegree** program is an intensive, hands-on course that focuses on:

- Building image classifiers from scratch
- Training deep neural networks using PyTorch
- Using transfer learning and object detection architectures
- Applying computer vision in real-world scenarios like facial keypoint detection, landmark identification, and automatic image captioning

The program was designed to prepare learners for roles in computer vision, AI research, and applied machine learning. Through real-world projects and an industry-reviewed curriculum, I gained practical experience that mirrors modern computer vision workflows.

## üìä Projects

Each folder in this repository corresponds to a completed project:

### 1. **Facial Keypoint Detection**
Detect facial landmarks using CNNs trained on grayscale facial images. Preprocessing included normalization, augmentation, and heatmap generation.

### 2. **Landmark Classification & Tagging for Social Media**
Built a model that identifies the location of a photo using image classification techniques. Applied transfer learning and TorchScript to export models for app integration.

### 3. **Automatic Image Captioning**
Combined CNNs and RNNs to generate image captions. Built an end-to-end encoder-decoder model using PyTorch, trained on MSCOCO-like datasets.

### 4. **Face Generation with GANs**
Built and trained a Generative Adversarial Network to generate new, realistic human faces. Experimented with discriminator and generator architectures.
